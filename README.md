House Price Prediction
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for real estate prices using data collected from the web. The objective is to provide fast and accurate price estimates useful for tenants, buyers, sellers, and investors.

The CRISP-DM methodology was followed, including business understanding, data exploration and preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment planning.

The challenge lies in accurately predicting house prices based on features such as area, location, number of rooms, and property type. Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting categorical data to numerical format.

Several machine learning algorithms were tested, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. XGBoost demonstrated the best performance by effectively managing complex data relationships and delivering the most accurate predictions
